## Introduction üìå

In the light of COVID-19 Pandemic, while many Schools, Colleges and Universities have resorted to Online Classes and Lectures, very less attention has been given up on improving the state of Online Examinations. Students who lacked proper facilities with respect to their Online Setup faced difficulties in stacking up their Answers dur to connectivity issues. This issue has plagued the state of the examination in many Third-World Countries where a proper Internet Connection is still a dream for many. 

With this Web Application, we aim to solve the Connectivity Issue by leveraging Offline Sync Capabilties where the Student can attempt the examination even Offline or in low-bandwidth Internet Connections. Our Application aims to bridge this gap between the Students and the issue of Online Exams with an easy-to-use lucid yet intuitive interface.

## Technology Stack üèÅ

- [Flutter Web](https://flutter.dev/web)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why this Project?

Our primary purpose behind this project is to leverage and study how we can make use of Encryption and Offline Sync Features to streamline the process of Online Examinations. With the rise of the COVID-19 Pandemic, Internet Connectivity has been an issue for Students and we aim to provide them an application which would allow them to sit for these exams by leveraging these features which would allow them to submit their answers, even if they are offline. 

The Minimal Viable Product (MVP) would allow the Teachers to organize Multiple Choice Based Questions (MCQs) and send them over to the Student who can then attempt them at a fixed time period and can even submit it offline. The cornerstone of the Application would be its Offline Sync Capabilities and its fluid User Interface which would be easy to use and handle. 

For this project, we will be  collaborating  on various domains like:

- UI/UX Development with Flutter 
- Data Storage with Firebase 
- Offline Database Storage and Synchronization
- Encryption Utility for Flutter
